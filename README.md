# Toy Projector Firmware

This project is a simple implementation of a **Toy Projector Firmware** written in C. It simulates receiving and processing image data packets sent to the firmware, which can be displayed as ASCII art or any other image-like representation.

## Features

- **Packet Validation**: Validates the incoming data packets for header and length.
- **Image Data Display**: Processes chunks of image data and outputs them to the console.
- **Data Erasure**: Clears the console screen for a fresh display.
